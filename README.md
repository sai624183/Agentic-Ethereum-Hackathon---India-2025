🌍 GeoTrust — Ethereum-Based Fraud Detection Protocol
GeoTrust is a decentralized fraud detection system that bridges blockchain technology with real-world GIS (Geographic Information System) data. It addresses a critical gap in online banking security by verifying the physical feasibility of a user’s location during sensitive transactions.

🚨 Problem Statement
Traditional fraud detection mechanisms rely heavily on IP addresses and basic heuristics. Attackers can easily bypass these systems using VPNs or spoofed identities. GeoTrust tackles this by introducing a novel way to validate users using:

IP geolocation data

Google Maps Timeline GPS trails

GIS-based travel feasibility analysis

🔒 Our Ethereum-Based Solution
GeoTrust leverages smart contracts and on-chain verification to build a tamper-proof, privacy-consented fraud risk engine:

🛰️ Travel Feasibility Engine: Calculates whether a user could have realistically traveled between two locations in the given time.

📍 Location Inconsistency Detection: Uses GPS trails and IP data to flag suspicious logins or transactions.

🧠 Risk Scoring System: Considers travel speed, VPN/proxy detection, device fingerprint mismatches, and IP reputation.

🔗 Soulbound Tokens (SBTs): Assigned to accounts to represent fraud risk or verified trust.

🧾 On-Chain Transparency: All evaluations are logged immutably for audit and governance.
